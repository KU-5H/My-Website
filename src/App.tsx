          I'm a Second/Third year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitian University, though nowadays that's nothing special 😂.
          Anyways, I'm super passionate about all things coding (and gaming 🎮), and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
          This is just a nice place to put all of my projects and stuff, so feel free to look around!

          Some other notable things ........ nothing really lol. Currently I'm working as a Software Developer at Kijiji, and 
          I try and make some cool projects from time to time.
